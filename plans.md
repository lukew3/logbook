Add functionality that will delete the file if nothing was written other than the date and time
    Maybe that can go in another application that cleans garbage files with no information in them

Eventually you should make this part change the directory to a path that the user chooses, after that path has been chosen the path will be stored in a text file beside the logbook.py program which will tell the program where to put the log files at.

Figure out how to launch the program from the desktop or maybe just one short command from the terminal
  would alias allow me to run the program by typing in something like "logbook" to change directory and run the file

One program will be ran the first time it is used in order to set up directory and alias

Sync logs to MEGA with another program

Simplify code in the combineLogs program

Make concatenated logbook look better and more organized
